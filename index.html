<h2>What is 2values?</h2>
    <p>2values is, in essence, a political quiz that attempts to assign percentages for two different political values. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!</p>

<h2>What are the eight values?</h2>
    <p>There is one indendent axis - Are traps gay, or not? - and it has two opposing values assigned to it. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Traps are gay</b><br/>
        Those with higher Traps are gay scores believe that traps could be homoerotic.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">Traps are not gay</b><br/>
        Those with higher Traps are not gay scores believe that traps are rather not homoerotic.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the two values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the values and axes, so don't take it too seriously. If you disagree with your assigned ideology, Thanks!</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
    If you have any suggestions or constructive criticism, feel free to stick them up your butt.</p>
